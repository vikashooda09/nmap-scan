# nmap-scan
This repository contains my local network scanning exercise using Nmap and optional Wireshark packet analysis. It documents steps, commands, sample outputs, analysis, screenshots, and a brief risk/security discussion suitable for an internship submission.


⚠️ Important — Permission & Safety

Only run scans on networks and devices you own or have explicit permission to test. Scanning others' networks without permission may be illegal and unethical.

Perform this exercise in a controlled environment (home network, lab, or VM network).
